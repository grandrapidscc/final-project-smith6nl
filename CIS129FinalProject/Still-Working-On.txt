Problem Areas
-While loop for regular game.  Currently shows current player fading to black at 100 Health instead of 0.
-Unhandled Exception when using the random feature to set the Starting Location and Dungeon Exit.

Required Things to do
-Map functionality
    -Move location.  After encounters, replacing encounter variable with "empty".

Areas to Consider
-Enemies may be better grouped within one class

Details for after functionality
-Environment descriptions

Have to clear out a bunch of code that doesn't work.  This is most likely when I should be using Github,
but for some reason it is just habit for me to comment out things in order to try a different approach.  
This has a few times led to me having code that I am not using anymore left as a comment in my programs.
